# üéâ ML Kit Document Verification - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Now Implemented

### 1. **Front & Back License Capture** üì∏
- **BEFORE**: Only one "Driving License" document
- **NOW**: Two separate documents:
  - `drivingLicenseFront` - Captures front side with license number, name, father/husband name, DOB, issue/expiry dates, category
  - `drivingLicenseBack` - Captures back side with CNIC, address, blood group, PSV number

### 2. **Advanced ML Kit Validation** ü§ñ
- **OCR Text Recognition**: Automatically extracts text from both sides
- **Document Type Validation**: Verifies it's the correct document using side-specific keywords:
  - **Front**: License number, name, father/husband, category, dates
  - **Back**: CNIC, address, blood group, PSV
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each document gets a confidence score (stored in database)
- **Country-Specific Rules**: Supports multiple countries (US, UK, CA, AU, IN, DE, FR, PK)

### 3. **Data Extraction & Storage** üíæ

#### Frontend (Driver App):
- Extracts data from license using ML Kit
- Shows extracted data to the driver for verification
- Sends both image AND extracted data to backend

#### Backend (Node.js):
- **NEW COLUMNS ADDED** to `driver_documents` table:
  - `extracted_data` (JSONB): Stores all extracted information
  - `ml_confidence` (DECIMAL): Stores ML Kit confidence score
- Accepts both front and back license types
- Stores extracted data for admin review

#### Extracted Data Fields:

**From Front Side:**
- License Number
- Full Name
- Father/Husband Name
- Date of Birth
- Category (e.g., LTV, Motorcycle)
- Issue Date
- Expiry Date

**From Back Side:**
- CNIC (National ID)
- Address
- Blood Group
- PSV Number (if applicable)

### 4. **Updated Document Count** üî¢
- **BEFORE**: 5 documents required
- **NOW**: 6 documents required:
  1. Driving License (Front)
  2. Driving License (Back)
  3. Vehicle Registration
  4. Insurance Certificate
  5. Driver Photo
  6. Vehicle Photo

### 5. **Admin Panel Integration** üë®‚Äçüíº
- Admin can view extracted data alongside documents
- Extracted data helps verify document authenticity
- ML confidence score indicates reliability

## üìä Complete Flow

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Modified

### Frontend (Driver App):
1. **`lib/core/services/document_verification_service.dart`**
   - Updated `DocumentType` enum: Added `drivingLicenseFront`, `drivingLicenseBack`
   - Updated `_documents` map: Separate cards for front/back
   - Updated `_totalRequired`: Changed from 5 to 6
   - Added ML Kit integration in `uploadDocument` method

2. **`lib/core/services/mlkit_document_service.dart`**
   - Updated `_validateDocumentType`: Now handles front/back validation
   - Added `_validateDriverLicense(text, side)`: Side-specific keyword checking
   - Updated `_extractDocumentData`: Routes to front/back extraction methods
   - Added `_extractDriverLicenseDataFront`: Extracts front side fields
   - Added `_extractDriverLicenseDataBack`: Extracts back side fields (CNIC, address, etc.)

3. **`lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/verification_screen.dart`**
   - No changes needed - automatically displays 6 cards now

### Backend (Node.js):
1. **`src/routes/drivers.js`**
   - Updated `validTypes`: Added `drivingLicenseFront`, `drivingLicenseBack`
   - Updated upload endpoint: Now accepts and parses `extractedData` and `mlKitConfidence`
   - Updated INSERT/UPDATE queries: Store extracted data in new columns
   - Updated `requiredDocuments`: Changed to 6 documents with front/back
   - Updated default `totalRequired`: Changed from 5 to 6

2. **`add-mlkit-columns.js`** (Migration script)
   - Adds `extracted_data` JSONB column
   - Adds `ml_confidence` DECIMAL(3,2) column
   - ‚úÖ **MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Install updated driver app
- [ ] Select your country (Pakistan for your case)
- [ ] Upload front side of license
  - Should extract: Name, License#, Father name, DOB, Category, Dates
  - Should show extracted data on screen
  - Should upload successfully
- [ ] Upload back side of license
  - Should extract: CNIC, Address, Blood Group
  - Should upload successfully
- [ ] Upload remaining 4 documents
- [ ] Check admin panel:
  - Should see 6 documents total
  - Should see extracted data for both license sides
  - Should see ML confidence scores

## üìù What to Tell Me After Testing

1. **Did the app ask for both sides?** (Should show 2 separate cards)
2. **Was the data extracted correctly?**
   - Share a screenshot of the extracted data shown
   - Tell me which fields were found vs missing
3. **Did the backend receive the data?**
   - Check logs for "üìã Received extracted data"
4. **Any validation errors?**
   - Did it correctly identify front vs back?
   - Did it reject if you uploaded wrong side?

## üîß Next Steps (If Needed)

If extraction is not accurate for your country's license:
1. Share a photo of your license (blur sensitive info)
2. Tell me what keywords are on front vs back
3. I'll customize the validation patterns for Pakistan

## üéØ Expected Result

‚úÖ App now captures BOTH sides of license  
‚úÖ Extracts ALL information automatically  
‚úÖ Stores extracted data in backend database  
‚úÖ Admin can see extracted data when reviewing documents  
‚úÖ Driver cannot go online until ALL 6 documents are approved

**Ready to test!** üöÄ Install the app and let me know how it goes!
