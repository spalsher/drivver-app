# 🔐 GitHub Authentication Fix

## The Problem
- Repository `drivver-app` is PRIVATE
- Git can't push without authentication
- Need to authenticate to push code

## 🚀 Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Make Repository Public (RECOMMENDED)
**Benefits:** Free GitHub Actions, easier deployment

1. Go to: https://github.com/splasher/drivver-app/settings
2. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click **"Change repository visibility"**
4. Select **"Make public"**
5. Confirm the change

Then push:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Use Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Select scopes: **`repo`** (full repository access)
4. Copy the generated token
5. Use this command:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/splasher/drivver-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Use SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:splasher/drivver-app.git
git push -u origin main
```
