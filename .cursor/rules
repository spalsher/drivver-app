## Cursor AI Development Rules

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Production-Ready Code ONLY
- **NO MOCK DATA** - All functionality must use real data and real APIs
- **NO SIMULATIONS** - All features must work with actual user interactions
- **NO PLACEHOLDER LOGIC** - Implement real business logic, not demos
- **NO FALLBACK TO FAKE DATA** - If real data fails, show proper error handling
- **REAL FUNCTIONALITY ONLY** - Every feature must be production-ready

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow Flutter/Dart best practices and conventions
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add appropriate logging for debugging (but not excessive)

### Testing & Validation
- Test all functionality with real data before considering complete
- Validate all user inputs and API responses
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios gracefully
- Ensure proper loading states and user feedback

### Security & Performance
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all inputs on both client and server side
- Optimize for performance and memory usage
- Follow security best practices for data handling

### Documentation
- Comment complex business logic
- Document API endpoints and data structures
- Explain non-obvious implementation decisions
- Keep README files updated with setup instructions

### Mobile Development Specific
- Handle different screen sizes and orientations
- Implement proper permission handling
- Optimize for battery usage and network efficiency
- Follow platform-specific UI guidelines

### Backend Development
- Implement proper database schemas and relationships
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Follow RESTful API design principles

### Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on single features/fixes
- Use appropriate branching strategies
- Review code before merging

**Remember: Every line of code should be ready for production deployment.**
