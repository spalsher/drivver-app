# âœ… Build Issues Successfully Resolved!

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed:**

### **Problem:**
- Java version incompatibility between system Java (21) and Flutter/Android requirements
- Gradle build failing with JDK image transformation errors
- Common issue in Flutter Android development

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Installed Java 17** - More compatible with Flutter Android builds
2. **Configured Flutter** to use Java 17 specifically
3. **Updated Gradle wrapper** to version 8.7 for better compatibility
4. **Cleaned build cache** and rebuilt successfully

### **Commands Used:**
```bash
# Install compatible Java version
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk

# Configure Flutter to use Java 17
flutter config --jdk-dir=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64

# Update Gradle wrapper
cd android && ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=8.7

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter build apk --debug
```

## âœ… **Current Status:**

### **âœ“ Working Perfectly:**
- Flutter environment fully configured
